## üéØ Problem Statement

Many people struggle to track and understand their emotional well-being throughout their daily lives. Without proper tools to monitor mood patterns, reflect on experiences, and organize daily tasks, individuals often miss opportunities to:

- Identify emotional triggers and patterns
- Practice mindfulness and self-reflection
- Maintain mental health awareness
- Connect emotional states with daily activities and productivity

Our app addresses this gap by providing an integrated platform for mood tracking, journaling, and task management.
